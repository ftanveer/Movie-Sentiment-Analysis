PROJECT FILE: IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis.ipynb


## CONTEXT: 
Sentiment analysis for movie reviews from IMDB. 

We will be performing an unsupervised sentiment analysis using vector similarity and then comparing it against a supervised model accuracy. This notebook's vector models are derived from Ahmad Hashemi's medium article. To get a more intuition on the process, I laid out the steps in forms of vector operations.

## GOAL OF PROJECT:
To delve deeper into the mathematics of vector operations that is going behind vector similarity to obtain positive and negative scores that can be used to predict text sentiment without feeding any pre-existing labels.

## HOW TO RUN:
The notebooks can be run in Jupiter notebooks or any other IDE which supports ipython files.

## METHOD USED:
Vector similarity for unsupervised learning and logistic regression model for the supervised learning.

## CONCLUSION:
The unsupervised model did fairly well, 77% F1 score compared to a F1 score of 89% for supervised model.
